    <h1>Gboard’s Unusual Möbius Strip Keyboard</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>The latest creation from Gboard's Japanese department has people scratching their heads—a keyboard shaped like a Möbius strip. This peculiar design has caused quite a stir, with many wondering if it’s even real or simply a joke.</p>
    <p>The trailer for the keyboard humorously addresses the frustration of using a keyboard upside down, which led many to believe it might be an elaborate prank. However, the keyboard design is indeed real, and while it won’t be produced commercially, a 3D model of the keyboard has been released on GitHub for the curious to explore.</p>
    <p>Although this isn’t something that will end up on your desk, the Möbius strip keyboard serves as a reminder of the creativity and playfulness that Gboard brings to their designs. Who knows what they might come up with next?</p>
